# honey-pot

Honeypot 🍯 boilerplate form to detect bot 🤖 activity.

Disguises hidden form as real form to trick bots to filling them out. Real users will not be able to access honeypot fields as they are hidden from view. Once the form is submitted and data is saved to the database, a developer can easily distinguish which entry is real or fake.
